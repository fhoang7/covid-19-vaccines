# Covid-19 Vaccination Data Exploration and Visualization
Objective: Acquire data on covid-19 vaccination efforts across the globe and create an intuitive web app that allows users to see how vaccination is progressing worldwide.

## Data Cleaning
The data was obtained from a Kaggle dataset that published daily vaccination totals by country. I brought in a United Nations dataset on world population to assist with filling in missing values in the Kaggle dataset. My data cleaning work can be found [here](https://github.com/fhoang7/covid-19-vaccines/blob/main/scripts/data_cleaning.ipynb). 

Below is a screenshot of the number of missing values in the columns of the dataset pulled from Kaggle.

## Visualizations
I created three visualizations to highlight three key trends in the data: daily vaccination patterns (line graph), fully vaccinated population trends (world map), and total vaccination progress (bar chart). My hosted plot can be found [here](https://covid-world-map.herokuapp.com/myapp)!
